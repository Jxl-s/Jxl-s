# Hey there! 👋 I'm Jia

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Jxl-s&color=green&style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about everything in technology, but some of my niche interests include Elixir (the language), and web 3D graphics (check out my personal website, I'll work on a new one soon https://www.jiaxuan.li)

As well, I'm currently interested in full-stack development, UI/UX design, distributed systems, and AI.
