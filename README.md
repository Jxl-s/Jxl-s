Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about building and learning
new technologies. I'm currently diving deeper into computer graphics, Elixir,
DevOps, machine learning, and LLMs.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### Portfolio 2024

**[📁 Source Code](https://github.com/Jxl-s/portfolio-2024) | [🔗 Live
Site](https://www.jiaxuan.li)**

- My first portfolio website featuring both **2D** and **3D** experiences, as a
showcase of my creative vision.
- I'm currently working on a new version that will still feature a 3D experience, that is more user-friendly.

## 🏆 Hackathons

### LeetWrite (ConUHacks IX 🥈 2nd Place Winner)

- A "reverse-leetcode" platform where users describe code instead of solving
problems. It's a creative twist on traditional competitive programming.
- **2nd Place** at ConUHacks IX, with a **solo submission** among **800+
participants** and **180+ projects**, winning a **Meta Quest 3S** headset.
