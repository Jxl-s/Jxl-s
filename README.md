![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Jxl-s&color=green&stle=for-the-badge)

I am currently studying Computer Science, and I am passionate about software development. I mainly enjoy building applications, and I'm always open to learning new technologies.

Currently, I'm exploring web graphics, machine learning, grinding LeetCode, and I'm hopping on the hype train of AI/ML and LLMs.
